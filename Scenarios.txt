As a ticket vendor, I want to view the seating chart so that I can effectively sell tickets.

TTSA = Theater Ticket Sales App

Pre: 
Flow:
1. I select the view seating chart command.
2. TTSA reads the seating chart from file 'SeatAvailability.dat'
3. Guard 1 [SeatAvailability.dat exists]
   3.1 Exception flow
       3.1.1 TTSA responds with an error message
       3.1.2 Exit
4. Guard 2 [SeatAvailability.dat is properly formatted]
   4.1. Exception flow
        4.1.1. TTSA responds with an error message
        4.1.2 Exit
5. TTSA responds with the seating chart

Scenario: SeatAvailability.dat is missing.
1. I select the view seating chart command.
2. TTSA reads the seating chart but SeatAvailability.dat is missing.
3. TTSA responds with "SeatAvailability.dat is missing!".

Scenario: SeatAvailability.dat is badly formatted.
